In lieu of ""blatting"" and ""booming"", the band ends the song by returning to the 80s metal-inflected intro to close things out as the band plays out their then-unfulfilled (not for long) arena rock fantasies.

While not quite reaching the heights of the Charlotte version from earlier in the summer, this version certainly has merit. Atypical jamming for the song starts around 5:30 as Page begins playing some truly spooky sounds. Mike jumps in and together they create what sounds like the backing music to a scary movie. Trey and Fish eventually lead the band back to more familiar jamming and then a nifty segue -> ""Undermind.""",,5,1,,,0

1644953519,472441,683,1,2,2,0,2,1,"> from ""Mike's Song"" (in a show that would, ultimately, become a ""Groove"") slinky play emerges as the lyrics fade, the band riding a wonderfully-paced, feel-good wave. Check out Page, around the ten-minute mark, as he shakes things up, via his concert grand, a really cool passage that Trey responds to in kind. Page shifts to his keys, and play becomes refreshingly rocking, with a set of repeated riffs that are as pleasant as the surf smacking the shore. Trey breaks free, working the version to a strong peak before play uniquely cools to a perfectly placed ""Ya Mar.""  ",,8,1,"<p>My Soul (this soundcheck is likely incomplete)</p>

Breaking quickly from the song, the jam is very much of itself and perhaps, at least initially, rich with a bit more by way of those welcome Santana over- and undertones. But then. Listen in. The jamming, if not quixotic, has something of an exotic, offbeat, hushed and admirable atonal quality.  And then. Keep processing. Thanks in large part to Page, everything is something else completely. Quirky. But not quite. For Trey keeps working a number of warm melodies before play becomes pleasantly droning and noisy with Trey then screwing this heavy morass into ""Twist's"" signature riff.   ",,5,1,,,0
