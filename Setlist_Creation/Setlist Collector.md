Goose
-----
The Goose Setlist Collector is a Python-based tool that automatically gathers, processes, and structures detailed Goose concert data from both the El Goose API and the band's official website. It is designed to create comprehensive, analysis-ready datasets for research, statistics, and setlist archiving.

### What does the Collector do?
- **Automated Scraping:** Retrieves up-to-date information about Goose concerts, setlists, songs, venues, tours, and transitions.
- **Data Integration:** Merges data from multiple sources (API and website) to ensure completeness and accuracy.
- **Structured Output:** Produces clean CSV datasets, ready for data analysis, visualization, or further processing.
- **Rich Detail:** Captures song metadata, setlist order, transitions, jams, reprises, show notes, and more.
- **Incremental Updates:** By default, includes all past shows and the next future show on the schedule.

### Output Location
All generated files are saved to:
```
Data/Goose/From Web/
```

### How does it work?
1. **Initialization:** Import the GooseSetlistCollector and call `create_and_save_data()`, or use the SetlistCollectorManager for multi-band scraping.
2. **Scraping:** The collector fetches, parses, and merges data from the El Goose API and website.
3. **Processing:** Cleans, normalizes, and enriches the data (e.g., merges show/song info, parses transitions/jams).
4. **Export:** Writes all datasets to the output folder as CSV files.

### Example Usage
```python
from Goose import GooseSetlistCollector
collector = GooseSetlistCollector()
collector.create_and_save_data()
```
Or, using the manager:
```python
from SetlistCollector import SetlistCollectorManager
from Goose import GooseSetlistCollector

manager = SetlistCollectorManager()
manager.register_scraper(GooseSetlistCollector)
manager.scrape_all()
```

### Requirements
```
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

### Notes
- Only past shows and the next future show are included
- Song and show data are merged from API and website for richer output
- Setlists include jam, transition, and verification details
- Data is refreshed with each run
