# Creation and Purpose - 2/1/2025
The purpose of this repository is to store all code and data associated with my research and modeling project regarding jam band setlists. As of now, my plan is to include the following bands: Widespread Panic, Phish, Umphrey's McGee, and Goose. 

# Organization
The first folder that I will create will be called 'Data' and its purpose is self-explanatory. I will not create sub-directories for each band.

The next folder I will create will the first code folder and be called 'Setlist Creation.' It will only hold code related to either utilizing a website API or scraping a website to gain setlist datasets.
