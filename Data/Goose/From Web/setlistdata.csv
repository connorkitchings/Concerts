As the song leaves its post-verse melody, Rick introduces a palm-muted staccato line, tinkering before shifting to double time and weaving it into the opening melody. By 14 minutes, the jam plunges into a darker, synth-laden space, with Cotter steering the refashioned groove into shadowy depths. The melody returns as a blissy yet thunderous psalmic exploration that segues to the composed close.",,1.0,0.0
