303,1251168326,1983-10-30,7,61,1,"Throughout most of Phish history this was understood to have been the date of the first Phish show. The band believed this to be true as late as 1998, when on October 30 they celebrated their &ldquo;15th anniversary.&rdquo; Later research, however, revealed this to be incorrect, and that the correct date of this first show &ndash; commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; show or a &ldquo;Halloween Dance&rdquo; &ndash; is December 2, 1983."
347,1251253100,1983-12-02,7,1,0,"Trey, Mike, Fish, and Jeff Holdsworth performed what is believed to be their first public gig together as Phish on this night. The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand. Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album. The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire on the Mountain to drown out the band. The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master recording contains nothing after Treyâs sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire on the Mountain. All songs were, of course, Phish debuts. Back in Black was teased before Scarlet Begonias. While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect. The master copy of the recording of this show, as unearthed by Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro, contains a handwritten note that pegs the date as December 2, 1983. In discussions with Kevin, band members confirmed that they recall rehearsing for this show over the Thanksgiving Break, and that the show was a Christmas semi-formal. Also, it was not an ROTC-sponsored event; it was a dorm dance in a predominantly ROTC dorm (Mikeâs dorm at the time). It was long believed that the band's name for this show was ""Blackwood Convention"" but Trey advised in a 2019 radio interview that ""we were never fucking called 'Blackwood Convention.'"""

This show featured the first known performance of Camel Walk and the first known Phish performances of Wild Child, Bertha, Can&#39;t You Hear Me Knocking, Eyes of the World, and Whipping Post (which featured Jeff on vocals). CYHMK included a St. Stephen tease. Copies of this performance often circulate with the incorrect date of November 3, 1983.

This gig featured the first known version of Slave to the Traffic Light and Fluffhead, the first known Phish versions of Fire, Don&#39;t Want You No More, Cities, and Skippy the Wondermouse, and the only known Phish version of Spanish Flea.

During Makisupa, Trey noted that they were going to play Touch Me, but decided not to because Fish couldn't remember the words and they didn't know how have a horn section. To make it up to the crowd for letting them down, Trey brought out George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic (also known as The P. Funk All-Stars). Trey commentedÂ âand thatâs even<em> better</em> than Touch Me!â Page teased Touch Me while Trey was talking. The ensuing P. Funk Jam moved through pieces of several classic Parliament/Funkadelic tunes including Butt-a-Butt, Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker), P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up), and One Nation Under A Groove. Get Low (Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz) was also part of the medley. By the end of the jam, FishÂ was alone on stage playing vacuum. Fish then exited, leaving the stage empty. Phish returned alone to finish Makisupa; to prove that P. Funk was better than FishÂ singing Touch Me, Makisupa closed with FishÂ singing the first line of Touch Me <em>a cappella.</em> During the last chorus of Contact, Trey sang lines like âL.A. Womanâ and âMake my funk the P. Funkâ in place of his usual harmonies.</p>

The wombat broke the time machine and Ghost began with dancers and characters (like Father Time from December 31, 1999 and the Famous Mockingbird from December 31, 1992) continuing to appear from the band&#39;s past performances. Ghost featured Meatstick lyrics sung from the band as well as by dancers in different languages in a nod to December 31, 2010. The first Bohemian Rhapsody since December 31, 1996 (852 shows) featured the <em>Late Show</em> Gospel Choir singing on risers behind the band and Ghost quotes from Page and the choir with subsequent lyrics changed to reference Ghost. The first Jungle Boogie since December 31, 2003 (544 shows) featured the BD Entertainment Marching Band marching band along with the choir. The marching band and choir were also featured in Wilson where a platform above Trey that had appeared for the entire New Year&#39;s run descended and the clone that had been lying on the platform rose and was revealed to be a Tom Hanks actor from <em>Cast Away</em>. Inflated Wilson volleyballs were then tossed into the crowd. Only the final verse was sung in Wilson which contained Jungle Boogie quotes and was unfinished. During Auld Lang Syne, Phish briefly stopped playing and ate cake in front of the stage while the marching band and choir continued to perform. Carini featured several dancers in &quot;naked dude&quot; costumes emerging from a birthday cake in front of the stage and dancing and running around with security trying to catch them. The Theme from <em>New York, New York</em> was performed for the first time since December 31, 1997 (774 shows) and featured the naked dude dancers performing a kickline in front of the stage while adding vocals and Trey changing the lyrics to &quot;if I could be naked there.&quot; Page teased Tweezer in Caspian. Piper contained Crosseyed quotes. During Tweezer Reprise, the wombat ran and danced across the stage. The post show music was Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which was a nod to Phish playing their 72nd show at Madison Square Garden, tying Elton John.</p>

During the Harpua narration, Trey talked about some of the Harpuas and Phish shows at Madison Square Garden of the past 40 years, and a bed appeared from beneath the front of the stage with an actor playing Jimmy and a puppet version of Poster Nutbag. Trey then interrupted the song before the &quot;I want a dog&quot; lyric and said Jimmy had lacked a strong female influence over the years and introduced actress Annie Golden as Jimmy&#39;s grandmother. While consoling Jimmy, she told him it was time to tell the truth about the owner of Harpua. After telling Jimmy that the old man had given the puppet to Esther and helped Jimmy&#39;s cousin Reba make liquid meat, a vinyl record (with a rhombus on the cover) was brought forth and Jimmy&#39;s grandmother said &quot;it&#39;s time... it&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve and I can&#39;t let you ring another new year without knowing the real story of Gamehendge!&quot; leading into The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday and a glowing rhombus rising to frame the entire stage. The band then began the first performance of the Gamehendge saga since July 8, 1994 (1,194 shows), with Golden and Trey providing the narration and performers acting out the parts of Colonel Forbin, Rutherford, the AC/DC Bag, Tela, Errand Wolfe (later billed in post show credits as &quot;The Wolf&quot;), and the Sloth.

Before Melt, Trey asked Jimmy&#39;s grandmother if she knew that the mountain was a volcano, and the Lizards reappeared to dance to the ensuing Melt jam, eventually leaving the stage one by one as the rhombus was lowered again.</p>

"
2125,1701353198,2024-04-18,1597,207,0,"<p>The band took the stage while the pre-show electronic music continued. During Back on the Train, psychedelic images of passing countryside were displayed behind and above the band, rotating in opposite directions in different sections of the dome. Trey teased Mercy, Mercy, Mercy in Wolfman&#39;s Brother. During Maze, psychedelic live images of each band member appeared, stacked on top of each other. These images then fragmented and spread out, dancing and turning throughout the jam. During Leaves, several giant paper lanterns appeared, flanking the stage, while the dome showed a multitude of paper lanterns floating over water, with the moon shining above. During Life Saving Gun, the dome displayed stacks of old-style televisions with rabbit ears, with each television showing a live shot of one of the band members. These TVs moved and rotated as the jam progressed. After the song, Trey said that he &quot;loves any song with a Jon Fishman percussion rinse,&quot; and told the crowd they should see the Sphere from the stage. During Dirt, the dome showed a forest view, looking upwards through trees at a purple-hued sky. During Tweezer, a field of multi-colored cars appeared behind the band, changing in size and shape and with their headlights blinking on and off in patterns, while other cars drove past overhead. My Friend, My Friend included live spotlight silhouettes of the band members projected across the entire dome and Egg in a Hole quotes from Mike and did not contain the &quot;Myfe&quot; ending. The projections during Mike&#39;s Song made it seem as if the venue was outdoors, with the band playing in front of a body of water with a rotating sculpture on the far shore. During Lifeboy, the sun went down and a number of other rotating sculptures lit up in the sky, creating a golden star-scape. The sun then rose again during Weekapaug. Blaze On&#39;s lyrics were changed to &quot;dancing in the Sphere.&quot; Farmhouse began and ended with Trey on acoustic guitar, as well as images of a farmhouse in a field under a night sky filled with stars and aurorae. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was solid.</p>
"
2126,1701353225,2024-04-19,1597,207,0,"<p>The band took the stage while pre-show music similar to a Free jam played, which continued until they began the song and waterfalls of colored light suddenly cascaded from the top of the dome. During Moma, a moving, 360-degree live shot of the crowd and band was displayed, with psychedelic colors and effects. During Mercy, the dome displayed an overhead view of a sparkling ocean, with small birds in pastel colors flying over the water. During Gin, the entire dome became an overhead view of a large wave pool, filled with hundreds of people on food-shaped inflatables drifting and spinning. During the Gin jam, the images of the bathers became blurred and abstract, forming a neon kaleidoscope effect. During Theme, the entire dome became an underwater seascape, with kelp forest, fish, human swimmers, and light from the surface shining down from the top. Theme also contained a DEG tease from Trey. At the start of ASIHTOS, jellyfish puppets were raised on each side of the stage, while the dome remained dark. Once the jam began, the light on the dome came up to reveal another underwater seascape, whose plants and fish became luminous as the rest of the light dimmed again. During Caspian, this seascape changed to a view from within the columns and arches of a sunken monument. As YEM began, the entire dome became the view from inside of a car as it entered a &quot;Tunnel of Luv&quot; car wash, with the stage appearing to sit on top of the middle of the dashboard. The car progressed through the wash as YEM continued, with Trey&#39;s solo during the wax and wheel scrub, and the bass and drums as the car was dried and exited the wash. Suddenly the car view was gone, and it appeared that the dome was clear, with a puppy licking it from the outside, in slow-motion, for the duration of the vocal jam. During Velvet Sea, the dome appeared to be covered in flowing red velvet, with photographs of the band throughout the years appearing and disappearing among the fabric. By the end of the song, the entire dome was covered in photos. Trey teased The Secret of Life (The Dead Milkmen) in Hood. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was liquid.</p>
"
2127,1701353427,2024-04-20,1597,207,0,"<p>During Tube, the dome seemed to fill with soap bubbles which reflected the venue and drifted in front of a nebula of changing colors. During Pillow Jets, the view became that of a grassy path through a grove of trees under a starlit sky. Travelling down the path as the jam progressed, the grass and trees became tinged with glowing, multi-colored light, which periodically intensified and erupted from the ground through the branches, creating a firework effect. Mike and Trey teased Manteca during Steam. During Mountains in the Mist, the dome made it appear as if the venue was nestled in an evergreen-covered mountain range, with mist shrouding the sky from view. During Taste, the entire dome appeared to become covered in turning rings of Jim Pollock illustrations from the covers of the Live Phish CD releases, rendered in gold and black. During Sigma Oasis, the dome became a cloudscape, with trees, birds and sea creatures made out of bubbling clouds. During Fuego, a spotlight was used to create a silhouette of the band, with the image then recreated across the dome with effects added to make the band appear as flaming shadow people.

Prior to More, Trey thanked the production team behind the Sphere shows, and said that he thinks the band will return to the venue. After Slave, the band gathered at the front of the stage to take bows and have a picture taken in front of the crowd. This show was connected to the other three with each night&#39;s setlist tied into a state of matter. This performance&#39;s matter type was plasma.</p>
